# Changelog

Versions are the `version:` field in `skills/kb/SKILL.md`, and each is tagged at
the commit that introduced it. Breaking means a command that used to work now
refuses.

## 4.0.2

- A save that finds its earlier note missing writes it again and says so, rather
  than producing a theory about what removed it.

## 4.0.1

- `kb add --dir <fresh directory>` scaffolded nothing and ended in a traceback.
  A `--dir` with no notes in it now behaves like an empty working directory.

## 4.0.0 — breaking

- **kb does not touch a directory you are not standing in.** Every command
  taking `--dir` refuses a path outside the current one, reading included.
  `KB_ALLOW_OUTSIDE=1` restores the sweep for cron jobs that need it.

## 3.2.0

- `save` leads with a five-step procedure; the prose behind it is demoted to
  reasons, read when a step is ambiguous.

## 3.1.1

- The check for an existing note is two `ls` in the stream's own directory.
  Not a filesystem search.

## 3.1.0

- `kb streams` reads only sessions bound to the current directory. It used to
  take the newest transcript on the machine, which meant reporting another
  project's work.
- Default rose to five sessions per source.

## 3.0.1

- The rule against concluding "nothing to save" from memory is stated in
  `SKILL.md` as well, since harnesses differ on whether they load a skill's
  reference files.

## 3.0.0 — breaking

- Writing is confined to the working directory: `add`, `sync`, `adopt`, `hook`
  refuse a `--dir` outside it.

## 2.9.0

- `$HOME`, any directory on `PATH` and the system roots are refused as places to
  scaffold notes.
- Restored: with no kb anywhere, creating one is not decided silently.

## 2.8.0

- The five kinds and the writing rules move from `SKILL.md` into
  `references/save.md`. `/kb check` costs 30% less, `/kb restore` 19%.

## 2.7.0

- `adopt` verifies each backup against the file it guards, then removes it.
  `--keep-backups` restores the old behaviour.

## 2.6.0

- `kb streams` — which directories a session touched, read from the harness's
  own transcript rather than from recall. Handles Claude Code, Codex and
  Opencode without external helpers.

## 2.5.0

- The work-stream list comes from the transcript, not from memory of the
  session.

## 2.4.0

- A claim about the system gets a command before it gets written; a `decision`
  gets a search for an existing answer first.

## 2.3.0

- One session often touches several work streams. `save` enumerates them and
  asks which to write, instead of assuming the directory it happens to be in.

## 2.2.0

- `supersedes:` marks both index rows — `decision ⤺ 01` on the replacing note,
  `⤺ (reversed by 03)` on the replaced one.

## 2.1.0

- `check` follows links between notes, not only from the overview.
- `supersedes:` earns a job: a name declared superseded is history, not a broken
  link.
- `adopt` registers the directory it retrofits; `list --prune` stops printing a
  hint that repeats the command being run.

## 2.0.0

- The two skills merge into one directory and the CLI ships inside it — nothing
  depends on `PATH` or on `~/.local/bin`, which does not exist on Windows.
